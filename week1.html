					<th>Group Challenge with Clara and Ilyana. The first one is to build a device with straws that would stop the pingpong ball from above and hold it. Only three straws are allowed to touch the ground, and the pingpong ball will be droped from 5 feet.</th>
					<th>The final product after a short period of work, and it failed. Pingpong ball bounced off.</th>
					<th>Second challenge is to build the highest paper tower with several newspapers. Hanging from the ceiling is not counted.</th>
					<th>We built a tower with a cone-shaped base and thin cylinders stacking on top of it. The final height is 88 inches, beating all other groups in both classes.</th>
