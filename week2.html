					<th>In week 2, we learned how to build 3D models with Fusion 360. Basically, it is drawing a 2D sketch first and then extruding it in different ways to make it 3D.</th>
					<th>The first task is to build 6 models from the 50 blueprints given. They are pretty basic and can be finished easily by extruding one or several blueprints from various planes.</th>
					<th></th>

					<th></th>
					<th></th>
					<th>The second task is to build a 3D model of a hinge. It is more difficult since it requires the measurement of its parts to be the same, but it can be solved by fixing the diameter of cylinders used.</th>
					<th>The assembled hinge looks like this. All parts fit each other while leaving a small space for movement. Every part in the middle of this hinge uses Revolve when creating the model, and the two flat parts use Extrude method.</th>
