				  	<th>This week, we work on the electronics. Here, we connect the battery and motor to a breadboard and make the motor spin. Breadboard is a construction base for temporary circuits because it requires no solder.</th>
					<th>We connect a resistor and a LED in the circuit. Resistor limits the current by increasing resistance so that LED would not burn. LED is a light-emitting diode, and since it is a diode, it only conducts electricity in one direction.</th>
					<th>Another picture of resistor and LED when it is on.</th>
					<th>This is how to read a resistor. The first two bands give signficant values, the third band gives multiplying factor, and the fourth band gives tolerance range.</th>
					<th>Two LEDs are connected in parallel, meaning the circuit is broken into two paths.</th>
					<th>A LED is connected with a diode. Both components only allow current to flow in one direction, so flipping either will make the light go out.</th>
					<th>A electromagnet is connected. When introducing current through it, it becomes a magnet.</th>
					<th>A LED is connected with a switch and a capacitor. The capacitor can store electrical energy.</th>
					<th>A LED is connected with a transistor. The transistor amplifies or switches electronic signals.</th>
					<th>A LED is connected with a potentiometer. The potentiometer is a resistor that can adjust the output voltage, so it can adjust the brightness of LED.</th>
					<th>A circuit consisted of LED, capacitor, and transistor. The LED will keep turning on and off.</th>
					<th>A seven-segment display is connected. It displays numbers 0 to 9.</th>
					<th>A circuit consisted of LED, switch, and transistor. Once switch is pressed, LED will stay on even after switch is released.</th>
					<th>Another circuit of LED and transistors. There is another circuit with a microphone in it, but I forgot to take a picture of it.</th>
					<th>The next practice is to make a digital clock. </th>
					<th>To connect different parts of the clock together, we need to solder these parts on to a circuit board. We melt the soldering iron with a high temperature rod, put it on the connection of electrical parts and the board, and let it cool.</th>
					<th>The finished product. Make sure soldering iron does not go to neighbouring nods because that may cause short circuit.</th>
