					<th>This week, we use laser cutter and engraver for several projects.</th>
					<th>The first one is a clock designed by myself. The main theme is Mid Autumn Festival. The clock is designed by overlapping two cloud patterns with a circle, the moon. In that way, the cloud themselves will fall off because they are not connected to the circle, but the thin traces between the cloud patterns will remain and show the shape of cloud. The rabbit is cut separately and stick back.</th>
					<th>The next one is a press fit kit. </th>
					<th>They should be able to bit on one another, so the width of the openings should be the same as the thickness of wood board.</th>
					<th>The third one is a bookmark. It is made by laser engraving, which is basically leaving deeper or shallower trails on the wood without cutting through it.The girl engraved on it is a character from game Azur Lane.</th>
					<th>The last one is laser engraving on a glass. For this project, a rotary attachment is needed in order to spin the glass while engraving it.</th>
					<th>The final product. I used a black and white image of kindred, a character from game League of Legends. <a href="attachment/lc.zip" download>Click here to download all original files.</a></th>
