				  	<th>This week we work on sewing. The first project is sewing on a hat. Stack paper and hat like in the picture. The two blue squares are strong magnets so it may hurt hand.</th>
            				<th>Then slide this into the machine and enter the words wanted to print on the hat. Make sure the size and font fit and adjust where the words should be.</th>
            				<th>Finished product. Tear off the semi-transparent paper and cut of the white paper on the other side.</th>
				    	<th>The next project is sewing a pillow case. First, choose three fabrics. Cut the main one into 20 inches wide, the secondary one into 10 inches wide, and the last one into 5 inches wide.</th>
            				<th>Lay the three layers and pin their sides together. Make sure that the edges are aligned nicely. Then, sew the edge as you take out the pins. It was pretty hard for me to sew in a straight line as I often go sideways as I sew. Fold the case in half and do the same thing to the other side. This is called a Burrito Roll.</th>
					<th>Take the inside of the roll to the outside, and the pillow case is now done.</th>
