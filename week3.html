					<th>We use Brother GT-361 printer for t-shirt. Before and after we put the t-shirt in, we need to iron it so that the printer can have a flat surface to put ink on.</th>
					<th>The requirement is that the t-shirt must relate to WRA, Hudson, or Ohio. I chose WRA and drew a simple logo. W represents the Loomis Observatory, R represents school uniform, and A represents Chapel. All three letters use Reserve Green.</th>
					<th>The finished t-shirt looks like this.</th>
					<th>The mug is printed using Sawgrass 800 printer. It uses dye sublimation, a process of subliming the cooled ink printed on a piece of paper and leaving it on the mug. It can also print on other objects, like pencil cases or sandles.</th>
					<th>The image should be reversed before printing because it will be reversed again when transferring from the paper to the mug. Here, I used a free meme shared by a player of Grandblue Fantasy.</th>
					<th>After sublimation, throw the mug into water to cool down. The finished mug looks like this.</th>
					<th>The last project uses UV printer. I chose to print a marksman icon on a popsocket.</th>
					<th>The image used.</th>
