				  	<th>First project this week is making a skateboard. First, we put seven boards on top of each other. The patterns of the board can be either horizontal, making the wood hard, or vertical, making it soft. We stack the boards in the order: two horizontal, vertical, horizontal, vertical, two horizontal.</th>
					<th>Put glue between boards. The boards do not have to line up perfectly now.</th>
					<th>Put the glued skateboard between two bigger, heavier baords.</th>
					<th>Put several clamps so that there is enough pressure to make the skateboard kept in shape.</th>
					<th>Wait for a day to let the glue dry.</th>
					<th>After glue dried, use this machine to flatten edge of skateboard.</th>
					<th>Use this machine to smooth the edges.</th>
					<th>Use this machine to flatten two ends of skateboard.</th>
					<th>Decorate the skateboard with spray paint, laser engraving, or stickers. I meant to put a green 'WRA' on top of white background, but I did not let the background dry first and messed up.</th>
					<th>Other side of finished product.</th>
					<th>The next project is to make a mold for making chocolate. To start, I wanted my chocolate to look like a square with word 'RIOT' on it so I made a model in Fusion 360.</th>
					<th>Next, take a piece of wax and draw a cross on ones side with knife to locate its center.</th>
					<th>Put two stripes of tape on the other side of wax.</th>
					<th>Stick the wax into the MDX40A miller.</th>
					<th>Adjust the machine so that the drill points at the center of the wax. This will be the 0 for x and y axis for the miller.</th>
					<th>Put a sensor on top of the wax. Let miller find where the sensor is, and this will be the 0 for z axis.</th>
					<th>Wait for about a day. The miller will mill out the excessive wax to give the shape, so this is subtractive manufacturing.</th>
					<th>The finished base.</th>
					<th>Next, we use Smooth-Sil 960 to create the mold. Mix the liquid in yellow bucket and blue bottle in a ratio of 10:1.</th>
					<th>Remove the air in mixture by putting it into vaccuum chamber.</th>
					<th>Pour the mixture into the base from one corner. Gravity will evenly spread the mixture.</th>
					<th>Wait for a day, and then take the finished mold out.</th>
					<th>Finally, melt some chocolate.</th>
					<th>Pour chocolate into the mold and put it in fridge for about a minute. I put too much chocolate while pouring so it spilled out, and it was a lot of trouble removing the excessive part. This is also formative manufacturing.</th>
					<th>Base, mold, and chocolate all together.</th>
